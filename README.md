# üëãüèº Introduction
This is the capstone project I worked on after finishing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course. In this project I focused on Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. My task was to analyze smart device fitness data to gain insights into how consumers use their smart devices, in order to provide guidance for the Bellabeat marketing strategy. I used Python to analyze the given dataset and dive into the personal fitness data of 30 Fitbit users. Leveraging this data, I unlocked new insights and made recommendations for the Bellabeat app and membership program.

The provided dataset was made publicly available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data) and has the license of CC0: Public Domain. It contains the personal tracker data of 30 eligible Fitbit users.

# üìñ Background
You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Ur≈°ka Sr≈°en, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat‚Äôs products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat‚Äôs marketing strategy.

# ü§î The Questions

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

# üîß Tools I Used

For this project, I used these key tools:

- **Python:** This allowed me to analyze the given data and uncover valuable insights. I also used these libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** For analyzing data
    - **Matplotlib Library:** For visualizing data
    - **Seaborn Library:** For more advanced visualizations
- **Visual Studio Code:** This made executing Python scripts more convenient and efficient.
- **Git & Github:** These allowed me to share my Python scripts and analysis, and made sure versions were kept up to date.

# üìä The Analysis

## Data Exploration
I started by importing the data into my jupyter notebook and exploring the dataset. View my notebook with detailed steps here: [1_Prepare.ipynb](bellabeat_proj/1_Prepare.ipynb)

Checking unique values
```python
print(daily_activity.Id.nunique())
print(hourly_calories.Id.nunique())
print(hourly_steps.Id.nunique())
print(sleep_day.Id.nunique())
```

Checking data types
```python
daily_activity.dtypes
hourly_calories.dtypes
hourly_steps.dtypes
sleep_day.dtypes
```

Checking for null values
```python
print(daily_activity.isnull().values.sum())
print(hourly_calories.isnull().values.sum())
print(hourly_steps.isnull().values.sum())
print(sleep_day.isnull().values.sum())
```

## Data Preparation

The next step was to clean and prepare the data for analysis. View my notebook with detailed steps on my preparation here: [2_Process_and_Analyze](bellabeat_proj/2_Process_and_Analyze.ipynb)

I needed to transform some data types from object to datetime.
```python
daily_activity["ActivityDate"] = pd.to_datetime(daily_activity["ActivityDate"])
hourly_calories["ActivityHour"] = pd.to_datetime(hourly_calories["ActivityHour"])
hourly_steps["ActivityHour"] = pd.to_datetime(hourly_calories["ActivityHour"])
sleep_day["SleepDay"] = pd.to_datetime(sleep_day["SleepDay"])
```

I then merged hourly steps and hourly calories to create one hourly data table.
```python
hourly_data = pd.merge(hourly_steps, hourly_calories, how='inner', on=['Id', 'ActivityHour'])
hourly_data.head()
```

I also extracted the day from the datetime columns in each table, so I could analyze patterns based on day of the week.
```python
daily_activity["Day"] = daily_activity["ActivityDate"].dt.day_name()
hourly_data["Day"] = hourly_data["ActivityHour"].dt.day_name()
sleep_day["Day"] = sleep_day["SleepDay"].dt.day_name()
```

After tidying up my tables a bit more, my data was ready for analysis.

## Data Visualization

### For me, the best way to go about analyzing the data was to visualize relationships and gain insights from the visualizations. Let's start with activity data (steps, distance, and calories).

**1. Total Steps vs. Total Calories Burned**
```python
sns.scatterplot(data=daily_activity, x='TotalSteps', y='Calories', hue='Calories', legend=False)
sns.despine()
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

plt.xlabel('Total Steps Taken')
plt.ylabel('Total Calories Burned')
plt.title('Total Steps vs. Total Calories Burned per Day')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Scatterplot of Total Steps vs. Total Calories Burned](bellabeat_proj/images/totalsteps_v_totalcalories.png)

This graph tells me that total steps and total calories are positively correlated. The more steps taken in a day, the more calories burned.

**2. Average Total Steps vs. Average Total Energy Expenditure per Hour**
```python
sns.lineplot(data=hourly_table, dashes=False, palette='tab10', markers=True)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()

plt.xlabel('Hour of the Day')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.title('Average Total Steps vs. Average Total Energy Expenditure per Hour')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Line Graph of Avg Total Steps vs. Avg Total Energy](bellabeat_proj/images/avgtotalsteps_v_avgtotalenergy_perhr.png)

The step count starts increasing around 7AM, which could be when users most likely start their day. It increases again around 12NN, the lunch hour, and then declines before increasing again around 5-6PM, which could be related to working hours. It then shows a significant drop as users likely wind down for bed.
Calories burned experiences slight variations, showing slight increases and decreases with the associated step count.

**3. Average Total Steps per Day**
```python
day_order = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

sns.barplot(data=da_table, x='Day', y='TotalSteps', order=day_order)

plt.xlabel('')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.title('Average Total Steps Taken per Day')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Bar Graph of Avg Total Steps per Day](bellabeat_proj/images/avgtotalsteps_perday.png)

Total steps varies slightly throughout the week, with the highest count being on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and the lowest on Sundays. This could be associated with Sunday being a day of rest for most users.

**4. Average Total Distance per Day**
```python
day_order = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

sns.barplot(data=da_table, x='Day', y='TotalDistance', order=day_order)

plt.xlabel('')
plt.ylabel('Distance in km')
plt.title('Average Total Distance Travelled per Day')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Bar Graph of Avg Total Distance per Day](bellabeat_proj/images/avgtotaldistance_perday.png)

This graph clearly correlates with the previous one, with distance travelled being higher on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and lowest on Sundays.

**5. Average Total Energy Expenditure per Day**
```python
day_order = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

sns.barplot(data=da_table, x='Day', y='Calories', order=day_order)

plt.xlabel('')
plt.ylabel('Calories Burned')
plt.title('Average Total Energy Expenditure per Day')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Bar Graph of Avg Total Energy per Day](bellabeat_proj/images/avgtotalenergy_perday.png)

There is a slight variation in the amount of calories burned throughout the week, with Thursday being the lowest. This could be related to a dip in energy in the middle of the week.

### Now let's analyze sleep data (minutes asleep, time in bed, quality of sleep).

**1. Total Minutes Asleep vs. Total Time in Bed**
```python
sns.scatterplot(data=sleep_day, x='TotalMinutesAsleep', y='TotalTimeInBed', legend=False)
sns.despine()
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

plt.xlabel('Total Minutes Asleep')
plt.ylabel('Total Time in Bed (mins)')
plt.title('Total Minutes Asleep vs. Total Time in Bed')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Scatterplot of Total Mins Asleep vs Total Time in Bed](bellabeat_proj/images/totalminasleep_v_totaltimeinbed.png)

The graph shows a positive correlation between the two variables. There are a few outliers which show some cases of total minutes asleep being less than total time in bed, which could be related to users experiencing difficulty sleeping.

**2. Average Total Minutes Asleep per Day**
```python
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

sns.barplot(data=sleepdaily, x='Day', y='TotalMinutesAsleep', order=day_order)

plt.xlabel('')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.title('Average Total Minutes Asleep per Day')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Bar Graph of Avg Total Min Asleep per Day](bellabeat_proj/images/avgtotalminasleep_perday.png)

Users experience more sleep on Sundays, which again could be because Sunday is a day of rest.

**3. Average Total Time in Bed per Day**
```python
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

sns.barplot(data=sleepdaily, x='Day', y='TotalTimeInBed', order=day_order)

plt.xlabel('')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.title('Average Total Time in Bed per Day')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Bar Graph of Avg Total Time in Bed Per Day](bellabeat_proj/images/avgtotaltimeinbed_perday.png)

This graph correlates with the previous one, showing more time in bed on Sundays.

### Let's merge activity data and sleep data and analyze it to see if there are any relevant relationships.

**1. Quality of Sleep vs. Total Steps Taken**
```python
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

sns.scatterplot(data=activity_and_sleep, x='SleepQuality', y='TotalSteps', hue='TotalSteps', legend=False)
sns.despine()
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

plt.xlabel('Quality of Sleep %')
plt.ylabel('Total Steps')
plt.title('Quality of Sleep vs. Total Steps Taken')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Scatterplot of Quality of Sleep vs Total Steps Taken](bellabeat_proj/images/qualofsleep_v_totalsteps.png)

A lower quality of sleep does not necessarily result in a lower step total. This could be because some users walk to work everyday, regardless of their sleep quality. However, the cluster of points around the 90-100% sleep quality region shows that most users get quality sleep, and acquire varying step totals. The highest step counts are associated with better quality sleep.

**2. Quality of Sleep vs. Total Energy Expenditure**
```python
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

sns.scatterplot(data=activity_and_sleep, x='SleepQuality', y='Calories', hue='Calories', legend=False)
sns.despine()
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

plt.xlabel('Quality of Sleep %')
plt.ylabel('Calories Burned')
plt.title('Quality of Sleep vs. Total Energy Expenditure')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![Scatterplot of Quality of Sleep vs Total Energy](bellabeat_proj/images/qualofsleep_v_totalenergy.png)

Most users who reached higher amounts of calories burned also had a sleep quality of 85-100%. This shows a positive relationship between the variables, with better sleep resulting in more calories burned.

# üîé Main Takeaways

- **Activity and Sleep Tracking**: Fitbit users mainly use this device to track their steps, calories burned, and sleep data, much like other health tracking devices.
- **Variation in Activity**: Throughout each day, there are certain hours that show higher activity compared to others, which can be related to the natural course of the day. However, total steps, distrance travelled, and calories burned vary only slightly throughout the week, with Sunday commonly showing the lowest values. This points to Sunday being a rest day for most users.
- **Importance of Sleep**: Sleep quality and energy expenditure were shown to affect each other. Higher quality of sleep can lead to more calories burned, and burning more calories throughout the day can lead to a better sleep at night. This highlights the valuable impact of good quality sleep.

2. Bellabeat can keep user engagement high by making their app more interactive with personal goals, fun challenges, and motivational notifications.


# üì£ Closing Remarks
### Data Limitations
The first thing I noticed about the Fitbit dataset I was given to work with was that the data was **not sex disaggregated.** It would have been helpful to have another column that indicated whether the user was male or female. This would have significantly impacted the analysis and recommendations especially given that Bellabeat focuses on products for women. Sex disaggregated data would have helped me discover differences between male vs. female data, and leverage these insights to make the marketing strategy more tailored towards women. The second thing I noticed was that **the sample was small,** consisting of only around 30 participants. Since we don't know the ratio of male to female participants, we also don't know how credible this data really is in making recommendations for a women-focused brand.

### More Research
For future marketing improvements, Bellabeat can collect more data on their own consumers and compare this to data on users of Fitbit, Apple Watch, and other popular fitness tracker brands. Of course, for this to happen, more data must be collected and made publicly available by these brands as well.

### Final Thoughts
In all, working on this case study shed light on the importance of good quality data in making business decisions. Working with very limited data will also give you limited results. However, we also shouldn't let limited data hinder us from discovering valuable insights. It's important to do as much as we can with the available data, for business decisions are made stronger with real evidence to back them up. This project helped me practice my data analysis skills on real-world scenarios, and made me eager to learn and grow more as an analyst.
